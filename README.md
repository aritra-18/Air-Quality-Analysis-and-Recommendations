# Air-Quality-Analysis-and-Recommendations
In-depth statistical analysis of air quality data, focusing on CO levels and AQI. Explore findings and recommendations for healthier environments and clean air initiatives

**Introduction:**
This repository provides an in-depth analysis of air quality data collected from various sites. The goal of this project is to examine the air quality levels, particularly focusing on carbon monoxide (CO) and the Air Quality Index (AQI). The analysis aims to identify regions with unhealthy air quality levels and provide recommendations for improvement.

**Key Findings:**
- Carbon Monoxide Levels: The average AQI value in the dataset indicates safe levels of carbon monoxide, with 75% of the values falling below the standard threshold of 9 parts per million (ppm).
- Unhealthy Air Quality: While most regions exhibit satisfactory air quality, there are areas where the AQI values exceed the healthy threshold. These regions require further investigation to understand the factors contributing to the elevated AQI levels.

**Recommendations for Stakeholders:**

- Resource Allocation: Funding should be directed towards conducting thorough research in regions with unhealthy air quality levels. By understanding the root causes, stakeholders can take appropriate measures to improve air quality and safeguard public health.
- Identifying Problematic Regions: The analysis highlights the site at West Phoenix as having worse air quality compared to other sites. Additional resources should be allocated to further investigate and address the air quality issues in this specific region.
- 
**Conclusion:** This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of air quality data, emphasizing the significance of carbon monoxide levels and AQI values. Stakeholders are encouraged to review the findings, allocate resources effectively, and prioritize actions to enhance air quality in regions with unhealthy levels. With collective efforts, we can work towards ensuring cleaner and healthier environments for everyone.
